    I AM USING PYTHON 3.11.
    assumption: date_format is a string with format of  "%m/%d/%Y"
    fixed the date of 31st issues to match the DATE function in excel in case Issue_Date_data.day = 31
    xlsx file was saved at the same directory of python codes
    xlsx = pd.ExcelFile('Loan IRR.xlsx')
    the content in the Excel will need to exactly match what you send me in the email.
